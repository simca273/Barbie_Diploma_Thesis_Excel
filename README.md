## Conclusion

This thesis demonstrates that the Barbie brand influences consumers’ values and attitudes and has the potential to contribute to positive social change and the formation of attitudes among younger generations.  

The findings suggest a shift away from a single ideal of beauty toward supporting healthier self-confidence and ambitions among girls.  

At the same time, the results highlight the importance of localizing marketing communication to the Czech cultural context. The study confirms that culturally sensitive and value-driven communication plays a key role in shaping brand perception and consumer attitudes in the Czech Republic.
